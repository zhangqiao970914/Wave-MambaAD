# Wave-MambaAD: Wavelet-driven State Space Model for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
Our code is based on [ADer](https://github.com/zhangzjn/ADer). Replace MambaAD.py with [Wave-MambaAD.py](https://github.com/zhangqiao970914/Wave-MambaAD/blob/main/model/Wave-MambaAD.py) to run the code. We shall refine the code in due courseÔºÅ
